# Project Goal
  
  * You can make any game you want (more or less)
  
  * Requirements
  
     - Single player has to be possible
     
     - Three distinct zones/levels/maps/environments
     
     - Some form of computer-controlled characters with "interesting" behavior ("AI")
     
     - Unity strongly recommended, other options only with prior approval
     
  * In the last class we will play all of your games!

# Unity 

  * Unity is a game engine/middleware that simplifies many aspects of game development
  
  * Free for personal/educational use!
  
  * Asset store with many free assets
  
  * WebGL export capabilities
  
  * Install as soon as possible!

# Lectures
  
  * The lectures work alongside the project
