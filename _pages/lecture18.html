# Nav Meshes

  * Yesterday we talked about how to find a path in a graph 
  
  * But our game worlds are usually not graphs 
  
  * How do we build a graph, then?
  
  * If we take every position a character can reach as a node in a graph, the graph will be huge 
  
  * Solution: Nav Meshes

# Convex Polyhedra

  * Remember what we said about convex shapes?
  
--

  * Any point inside a convex shape can be reached from any other in a straight line!
  
  * So let's cut our game world into convex shapes 
  
  * 2D: Polygon, 3D: Polyhedron
  
  * The center of each shape is a node in our graph 
  
  * Two nodes are connected if their shapes share an edge (2D) or plane (3D)

# How do I get a Nav Mesh?

  * Nav Meshes can often be automatically calculated
  
  * Unity has built-in support for Nav Meshes (with pathfinding!)
  
  * Windows -> AI -> Navigation 
  
  * Then you select all game objects that constitute the level, and select "Navigation Static"

  * When you have selected everything you can "bake" the NavMesh  
  
---

class: small

# How do I use a Nav Mesh in Unity?

  * Add a NavMesh Agent component to your AI character 
  
  * Then you can simply tell the agent to move to a certain position 
  
  * The NavMesh Agent component will handle pathfinding *and* movement
  
```C#
GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>().destination = goal.position;
```

# Steering Behaviors

---

# Steering Behaviors 

  * Let's say our character moves like a car 
  
  * It can accelerate and break
  
  * It can also turn while going forward 
  
  * This works well, even for humanoid characters
  
---

# Steering Behaviors: Vehicle Model 

Every timestep:

   * Determine angle to target
   
   * Turn character towards target (up to a maximum angle)

   * Move the character forward by it's speed
   
Were do we get the target? Note: We are talking about "target positions", but it may be useful to use a "target direction" or "target velocity" instead.

---

# Steering Behaviors: Seek

Set any position in the scene as the target 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/seek.png" width="100%"/>

--

Problem: The character will circle its target

---

# Steering Behaviors: Arrival

What do drivers do when they get closer to their destination?

--

They slow down! Our character could do the same!

If the distance to the target is less than a threshold, reduce the speed.

---

# Steering Behaviors: Flee
<begin><table><tr><td width="60%">
   * We can now get *to* a target 
   
   * What if we want to get *away* from a target?
   
   * Fleeing!
   
   * Set the actual target in the opposite direction of what we're fleeing from!
</td><td><img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/flee.png" width="100%"/></td></tr></table>

class: small

# Steering Behaviors: Wander

What if we want to have a character that just wanders around?

--

* We could set targets randomly, but that might lead to some sudden changes

* Better: Keep the target on a sphere in front of the character, and only move it on that sphere

* The size of the sphere and the maximum change on it determines how sudden the direction of the character changes

---

class: small

# Steering Behaviors: Wander

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/wander.png" width="90%"/>

---

# Path following

 * Path following is easy

 * Make the target the first point on your path

 * When the character gets close, change the target to the next point

 * Repeat until the end is reached
 
---

# Path following

 * There is room for improvement! (as we'll see in the demo)
 
 * Instead of using each point on the path as a target, we can *interpolate* between the points to the one that is closest to the agent 
 
 * We should also add an offset in the direction of the path 
 
 * This way our agent will always try to get onto the path close to where they currently are
 
---

# Composition

 * The nice thing about steering behaviors is that they can be combined easily

 * When you have multiple steering behaviors, just add up their targets 

 * You may have to scale them

 * Easiest: Use Unit vectors

 * Why would we need that?
 
---

# Obstacle avoidance

 * What if we are following a path, but there’s an obstacle?

 * Idea: Define a steering behavior for obstacle avoidance, and combine it with path following 

 * Let’s say our obstacles are spheres

 * When the character gets too close, add a vector that points away from the sphere (orthogonal to its velocity) to its target
 
---

class: small

# Flocking
 
 * What if we have a group of characters? (Birds, sheep, people, etc.)

 * Use three different steering behaviors: Evasion, Cohesion, Alignment

 * Evasion: Try to get away from other characters, scale depending on how close they are 

 * Cohesion: Try to get to the average position of the flock

 * Alignment: Try to look the same direction as the other characters
 
---

class: small

# Steering Behaviors: Other tricks

 * Seek and Flee use static targets. We could predict the future position of moving targets and use that as our actual target

 * If your obstacles are not circles, it’s often ok to use circles anyway. If you have a long rectangle, use two or more circles.

 * If you don’t update the target every frame, that’s fine. You could even run the target calculation in a Coroutine (or a thread)

 * You may have to be careful with movements canceling each other out (especially with obstacle avoidance). You can use priorities, or simply scale them up differently.

# Inverse Square Root 

  * For Steering Behaviors we often use normalized vectors 
  
  * Turns out normalizing vectors is something that is also used often in graphics (normals, for example)
  
  * How do you normalize a vector? You divide by its length 
  
  * How do you calculate the length? It's the square root of the sum of the squares of its components
  
$$
v_n = \frac{v}{\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}}
$$
   
--

As it turns out, 1/sqrt(x) can be calculated "quickly".

---

# Fast Inverse Square Root

(Unedited from the Quake 3 source code)

```C
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
  long i;
  float x2, y;
  const float threehalfs = 1.5F;
  x2 = number * 0.5F;
  y  = number;
  i  = * ( long * ) &y; // evil floating point bit level hacking
  i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );  // what the fuck? 
  y  = * ( float * ) &i;
  y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );  
      // 1st iteration
//	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   
      // 2nd iteration, this can be removed
  return y;
}
```

# Fast Inverse Square Root 

  * Using an integer as a float is approximately the same as calculating the logarithm
  
  * Conversely, casting back to float basically performs an exponentiation
  
  * The line `y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );` is an iteration of Newton's algorithm on f(y) = 1/y^2 - 2*x2
  
  * And the weird line? It basically divides the number by 2, and performs some scaling and cleanup
  
$$
\log(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}) = -\frac{1}{2} \log(\frac{1}{x})
$$
