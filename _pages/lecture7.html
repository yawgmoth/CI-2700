# What's so great about Star Wars?

  * "It is a period of <b>civil war</b>. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic <b>Empire</b>. "
  
  * "*Tarkin*: The <b>Imperial Senate</b> will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently."
  
  * "*Leia*: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the <b>more star systems</b> will slip through your fingers."
  
  * "*Vader*: A tremor in the Force. <b>The last time</b> I felt it was in the presence of <b>my old master.</b>"

# What's so great about Star Wars?

  * The story does not *need* these references
  
  * But they give the story *context*
  
  * And a *purpose*
  
  * They allow audiences to imagine their own story within the larger world
  
---

class: small

# What about Video Games?

  * There are Star Wars games ...
  
  * Skyrim: Dragons were created by one of the gods
  
  * Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans (1994): Orcs come from <b>another world</b>, Draenor<br/>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (2007): Players can visit what's left of Draenor: Outland
  
  * Overwatch: "Long before she took up the alias "Sombra," Olivia Colomar was among the thousands of children who were left orphaned in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis."
  
  * Stardew Valley: Pelican Town is located within the Ferngill Republic, at war with the Gotoro Empire across the Gem Sea

# Non-player characters (NPCs)

  * In stories, characters serve the story
  
  * In games, characters serve game play (and story)
  
  * Instead of characters, create <b>roles</b>
  
  * These roles can then be filled by characters as needed 

---

# NPC roles, examples

  * Mentor: gives players advice/quests/pointers
    
  * Assistant: helps player with quests 
  
  * Villain: the main antagonist
  
  * Minion: helps the villain
  
  * Town folk: require help from the player
  
  * etc.
  
---

# Character traits

  * Background

  * Likes/dislikes
  
  * Temperament
  
  * Goals
  
  * Alliances/Enemies
  
  * World view

# Narrative

---

class: small

# Narrative

  * Characters actually *do* something
  
  * Narrative consists of two parts:

     - Story: What is happening
     
     - Discourse: How is it told
  
  * The story does not have to be explicitly defined in the game
  
---

class: small

# What drives the story?

  * Goals 
  
     - Character goals 
     
     - Authorial goals 
     
  * Obstacles 
      
     - Something does not work out as planned
     
     - Someone else is trying to interfere because of a conflicting goal
     
---

# Story

  * Remember the pencil, eraser, book?
  
---

class: small

# Discourse: How do we actually tell the story?

  * Cut scenes
  
  * Dialog
  
  * In-world artifacts

  * Interactions  
  
---

# History

class: small

# What about the player?

  * The narrative can guide the player along the levels
  
     - Player has to resolve the obstacles
  
  * The player could also make decisions that influence the narrative 
  
     - Branching stories 
     
     - Combinatorial explosion
     
  * There is no story, the narrative emerges from interactions

---

# Social Aspects: What's in the world?

  * Inclusive designs
  
  * Representation of cultures
  
  * Stereotypes

# Economy

## (In Massively Multiplayer Online Games)

---

class: small

# Economy

  * If there is any way to trade, there is currency
  
  * In most games, everyone can produce anything (given enough time)
  
  * The fundamental unit of value is therefore "time"
  
  * Fun also plays a role: If everyone does the same dungeon, items found in that dungeon will drop in value
  
---

class: small

# Economy: Let's say there is money/gold

  * You get some money for killing a monster
  
  * Many players kill lots of monsters
  
  * Money is actually "harvested", because it has no theoretical maximum quantity
  
  * That's why your equipment "breaks", transportation costs money, etc.
  
  * Other option: You don't get incidental money (EVE Online)

# Auction Houses

  * Sell-order only 
  
  * Buy- and sell-orders
  
  * Final Fantasy XIV (2010)

     - Retainers
