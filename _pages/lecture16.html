# Question 

Your level designer has created a mandatory tutorial level for your game. In it, the player is given a book by their mentor that contains written instructions for every magic spell in the game. In the tutorial, the player is transferred to a magic realm where they have to practice every spell in the book in the right order. If they fail, they are reset to the start of the tutorial. In the end, it is revealed that the mentor is actually the murderer of the player character's parents, after which the game starts.

## Name at least three problems with this tutorial design.

#  Homogeneous Coordinates, Matrices, Quaternions

---

# Question 

## What are homogenous coordinates, and why are they useful?

---

# Question 

A "shear" is an operation, where each vector's x coordinate is moved c*y units to the right.

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
x \\\\ 
y
\end{pmatrix} \mapsto 
\begin{pmatrix} 
x + c \cdot y \\\\ 
y
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Define the matrix for a shear of 2D vectors in homogeneous coordinates.

---

# Question 

Calculate the matrix to rotate a 3D vector by 135 degrees around the z axis, and then rotate it by 45 degrees around the x axis. Apply this matrix to the vector

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 \\\\ 
0 \\\\
\sqrt{2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Hint:

$$
\sin(45) = \cos(45) = \sin(135) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \cos(135) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
