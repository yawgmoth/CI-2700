### Games

# Non-traditional Games

# Non-traditional Games

  - As we discussed, it is hard to define what a "game" is 
  
  - Over the last few decades, several genres and kinds of games have established themselves 
  
  - However, there are many less explored ways to make games 
  
  - Let's look at a few of those!

---

# Zen Games 

  - We said that (most) games have rules and goals
  
  - Sometimes all you want is to watch something grow (or burn)
  
  - Maybe with some minor interaction component 
  
  - There may be some progression, for example to unlock new items
  
---

# Example: Bohm

"Bohm is a game where you control a tree. Slow gameplay lets you discover the simple beauty of a growing tree. A zen-like, soothing experience that isn't about winning or losing."

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/bohm.png" width="60%"/>

---

# Example: Little Inferno

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/littleinferno.jpg" width="100%"/>

---

# Life Simulations

  - Remember that games are often used for fantasy/wish fulfillment 
  
  - Some of these wishes might just be "what if I had a different job?"
  
  - Especially recently, the "_ Simulator" games have exploded in popularity
  
  - Some of these are more realistic than others
  
---

# Example: Papers, Please

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/papersplease.jpg" width="100%"/>

---

# Games in Unusual Environments 

  - Just as the definition of what a "game" is can be pushed, so can the environments they are implemented in
  
  - For the project we used Unity
  
  - But any interactive medium can serve as a platform for games, with some creativity
  
  - Note that these games are not necessarily "practical", but merely technology demonstrations (or pranks)

---

# Example: World of Tweetcraft 

  - In 2012 three (then) PhD students wanted to play an action RPG on Twitter 
  
  - So they implemented a bot that you could tweet at to participate in dungeon runs and slay monsters (including bosses)
  
  - Unfortunately the bot is no longer active :(
  
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sgware?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sgware</a> smashes a fancy pirate with a old crossbow of vileness and does 50 damage!</p>&mdash; World of Tweetcraft (@worldtweetcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/worldtweetcraft/status/258218383718379523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2012</a></blockquote>

# Example: Tetris on the Green Building at MIT

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/tetrisgreen.jpg" width="40%"/>

# Accessibility

  - Games are often not the most accessible software 
  
  - Nowadays they often at least include a colorblind mode and subtitles
  
  - But what about other disabilities?
  
  - For example, how do you make a "video" game without video?
  
  - Audio games!

---

# Example: A Blind Legend

"A Blind Legend is a collaborative project of an audio-only action/adventure game for mobile phones. It's based on a very innovative technology: binaural sound. In this game, the players are guided only by 3D sound and live the adventure by controlling their hero with multi-point tactile gestures. A Blind Legend is above all a story: an adventure from the Age of Chivalry, to which we want to give epic scope."

A review:

<span style="font-size:80%">"The combat is very easy at first, but gets harder after a while: enemies will move during combat, and depending on where they are located, you must press the corresponding arrow key. When there are more enemies, it gets even more fun. There are only a handeful of fights that kinda frustrated me, but the game balances the difficulty very well."</span>

---

# Interactive Fiction

  - Some games are very story-driven
  
  - Movies are stories without a game 
  
  - What if we add some interactivity?
  
  - Where does the concept of "movie" end, and that of "game" start?

---

# Example: Bandersnatch

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/bandersnatch.jpg" width="100%"/>

# Example: The Stanley Parable

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/stanley.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Example: Façade

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/facade.jpg" width="80%"/>

---

# Video Games for Pets

  - Humans are not the only species that likes to play 
  
  - When we think of pets playing, we usually imagine physical activity
  
  - However, there is no reason this couldn't involve something like a "video game"
  
  - The score/reward should still be something tangible, like a treat 
  
---

# Example: CleverPet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jack has a very intense love/hate relationship with <a href="https://twitter.com/getcleverpet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@getcleverpet</a> <br><br>He LOVES that it gives him food... so much so that he can&#39;t think straight. <br><br>Then he gets mad at it when he doesn&#39;t do the sequence right (as evidenced by his floofy tail). <a href="https://t.co/ZyOQ4FIfij">pic.twitter.com/ZyOQ4FIfij</a></p>&mdash; PJ (@OtherKnave) <a href="https://twitter.com/OtherKnave/status/1071090963861381125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

# ASODEV Costa Rica

  - Asociación de Desarrolladores de videojuegos de Costa Rica 
  
  - One of the goals of the organization is to grow the games industry in Costa Rica 

  - For this year's GDC they had 16 (free) passes that they gave out to applicants 
  
  - Every first Wednesday in the month they have a breakfast, 9-11am, at Match Cafe!

# Games Research

# Technical Games Research 

  - Because games are an important industry, there are many people doing research on games 
  
  - The two most common areas of research are AI and graphics, but there are also people that research games as cultural artifacts, game design, user interfaces, etc.
  
  - As mentioned before, AAA games don't necessarily use this research right away
  
  - But many of the games researchers also produce games using their techniques, either as demonstrations or even to publish them
  
  - Overall more than 637 institutions around the world do games research

# UCR, ECCI

  - I am currently working on non-verbal communication in video games 
  
  - For example, how can an AI agent use eye-tracking to understand a human player better 
  
  - We're also looking at the timing of actions, and facial expressions
  
  - Currently our applications are cooperative games, such as Hanabi or Pandemic 
  
  - I'm interested in AI for games that plays with human players
  
  - If you're interested in working with me, come talk to me!
