  * Work in groups of 4
  
  * Three milestones: Design document, protoype, finished game 
  
  * Progress update *every Monday* (usually 5 minutes per group)

# Project Goal
  
  * You can make any game you want (more or less)
  
  * Requirements
  
     - Single player play has to be possible
     
     - Three distinct zones/levels/maps/environments
     
     - Some form of computer-controlled characters with "interesting" behavior ("AI")
     
     - Unity strongly recommended, other options only with prior approval

  * Other lectures contain more advanced algorithms and methods
  
  * If the need arises, I can shuffle lectures around
  
  * There will be *two* exams, mid-term and final 
  
  * Questions about *your* project might be part of the exam

# Support
  
  * You will be learning Unity/C# as part of the project 
  
  * Many excellent tutorials online
  
  * If you encounter problems: Ask on Piazza, maybe others have encountered similar problems
  
  * Help each other! 
  
  * Of course I will also be answering questions

# To Dos
  
  * Find a group for the project (Piazza)
  
  * Give your group a name (can be funny, a pun, a reference)
  
  * Work on 3-5 game ideas
  
  * Present your group, name, and game ideas next Monday, January 14
  
  * Each group has 10 minutes!
