# Procedural Content Generation

  * Making games requires a lot of effort 
  
  * Apart from coding, there are also art assets, music, a story, etc. that need to be created 
  
  * Some of these creation processes can be (partially) automated, or assisted: Procedural Content Generation (PCG)
  
  * Two problems
  
     - Generating content is not always easy
     - Generating *good* content is usually even harder
     
---

class: small

# What can we generate?

  * Levels
  
  * Enemies 
  
  * Quests 
  
  * Dialog
  
  * Narrative 
  
  * Plants 
  
  * 3D objects
  
  * Rules 
  
  * Games 
  
  
---

class: small

# PCG Methods 

  * Search-based
  
  * Solver-based 
  
  * Grammar-based 
  
  * Cellular Automata
  
  * Noise
  
  * Machine Learning

# Search-based approaches
  
---

# Search-based approaches 

  * Remember pathfinding?
  
  * Sometimes we want to "find" a path that doesn't even exist yet 
  
  * For example, to dig a cave/maze 
  
  * Or to connect two cities with roads 
  
  * The cost function for this will involve some gameplay or aesthetic properties
  
---

# Search-based approaches: Road generation

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/roadgen.png" width="100%"/>

---

class: small

# Search-based approaches 

  * So far, we've used actual geometry to search for paths
  
  * What if every node in our graph is a "level" for a game
  
  * Some levels are incomplete, bad, impossible to finish, etc.
  
  * Say we can connect two levels with their difference (e.g. adding a block in Super Mario)
  
  * If we know what a "good" level looks like, we can search through this graph

---

# Search-based approaches: Story generation

  * We can also have the computer generate a story 
  
  * Stories are sequences of actions that reach a conclusion 
  
  * That sounds a lot like planning!
  
  * Idea: Author defines a "world" consisting of actions the actors can take, and a goal for the story
  
---

# Search-based approaches: Story generation

  * Let's generate a heist!

  * We have a bandit, a bank, a clerk, a safe, etc.
  
  * Goal: The bandit has the safe
  
  * Story: The clerk takes the safe and brings it to the bandit's house
  
  * Is that a good story?
  
---

class: small

# Search-based approaches: Story generation

  * The problem is that the planner finds an efficient solution
  
  * Stories are not necessarily efficient
  
  * In particular, not every character always works towards the goal of the story 
  
  * Introduce intentions: Actors can only execute actions if they aid their own goal 
  
  * Introduce conflict: Actors can plan to execute actions, but other actors might interfere
  
  * There are many more extension, e.g. to add interactivity

# Solver-based approaches
  
---

# Solver-based approaches 

  * What if we know certain properties a "good" level/quest/art asset has to have?
  
  * If we phrase our level design problem in a logical way these properties become constraints in the formula 
  
  * There are tools that find assignments of logical variables to formulas that take constraints into account 
  
  * Such an assignment is then a level/quest/art asset 
  
---

class: small

# Example: CatSAT

  * Say we want to generate a quest 
  
  * There are 3 types of quests: Retrieve, deliver, and kill 
  
  * There are 4 types of enemies: Bandits, another kingdom, orcs, and wolves
  
  * There are some constraints on the possible quests:
       - You can't retrieve an item from the wolves
       - No more than 2 types of enemies should be present in any quest 
       - The bandits do not work together with the other kingdom 
       - etc.

---

# Example: CatSAT 


```C#
var p = new Problem("quest");
...
var retrieve = (Proposition)"retrieve";
...
var wolves = (Proposition)"wolves";
...
p.Inconsistent(wolves, retrieve);
...
p.AtMost(2, bandits, others, orcs, wolves);
...
p.Solve();

```

# Grammar-based approaches

# Grammar-based PCG

Remember grammars?
  
$$
A \rightarrow B A C\\\\
A \rightarrow \varepsilon\\\\
B \rightarrow b\\\\
C \rightarrow c
$$

---

# Tracery

```JS
{
  "origin": "#greeting#, #noun#!",
  
  "greeting": ["Howdy", "Hello", 
               "Greetings", "What's up", 
               "Hey", "Hi"],
  
  "noun": ["world", "solar system", 
           "galaxy", "local cluster", 
           "universe"]
}

# L-Systems 

  * Named after the Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist Aristid Lindenmayer
  
  * Idea: Instead of words, a grammar generates plant growth
  
  * For example: F draws a line "forward", - turns left, + turns right, the brackets store and retrieve the current drawing position
  

$$
X \rightarrow F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X\\\\
F \rightarrow FF
$$

# Shape Grammars

  * We can use a similar idea as L-Systems for 3D geometry 
  
  * In a grammar you start with a sentence and divide it into parts with meaning
  
  * In a Shape Grammar, you start with a block, and divide it into parts with meaning 
  
  * For example: 
     - Start with a cylinder, cut it into n slices radially
     - For each of the slices you cut out a part in the center and decorate the edges 
     - You now have a gothic window 
     
  * Note: If you do this well, you can change n, the cutout shape, and the decoration arbitrarily

# Cellular Automata-based approaches

class: small

# Cellular Automata 

  * Cellular Automata are zero-player games on a grid 
  
  * The basic idea is: Every cell has some states (sometimes just "on" and "off"), and there are rules for how to update the grid 
  
  * Most famous Cellular Automaton rules: Conway's Game of Life
  
     - If a cell is "on" and has two or three (of its eight) neighbors that are also "on", it will continue being "on", otherwise it is turned "off"
     - If a cell is "off" and has exactly three (of its eight) neighbors that are "on", it will turn "on", otherwise it stays turned "off"

class: small

# Cellular Automata 

  * How is this useful?
  
  * Different rules make different shapes!
  
  * Let's say we want to generate caves:
      - Fill the grid randomly with "on" and "off" cells 
      - A cell is turned "on" if five or more of its neighbors are "on"
      - Run for a number of generations

# Noise-based approaches

---

# Midpoint Displacement

  * Say we want to generate some (2D) hills 
  
  * We draw a straight line to begin with
  
  * Then we cut the line in half, and add some random noise to the center pointer
  
  * Afterwards, we recursively perform the same operation on the two new line segments
  
---

# Midpoint Displacement 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/midpointdispl.png" width="50%"/>

---

# Midpoint Displacement

```JavaScript
var displace = function (a,b, size)
{
    if (a == b || (a+1) == b) return;

    var mid = a/2 + b/2;

    var x = geometry.vertices[mid].x;
    var y = (geometry.vertices[a].y + geometry.vertices[b].y)/2;
    var z = geometry.vertices[mid].z;

    geometry.vertices[mid] = new THREE.Vector3( x, 
                              y + size*(Math.random() - 0.5), 
                              z);

    displace(a, mid, size/2);
    displace(mid, b, size/2);

# Machine Learning-based approaches

# Markov Chain Generation

  * A Markov chain consists of states and transition probabilities 
  
  * We start in some state, and then choose the next state based on these probabilities 
  
  * For example: Each letter in a word is a state, and there are different probabilities for the next letter (in English, an x will not often follow a w)
  
  * You can also use multiple previous letters/states
  
---

# Markov Chain Generation: Words

  * Let's generate names for data structures!
  
  * Input: Names of existing data structures 
  
  * Train Markov Chain on sequences of letters 
  
  * Output: Start at a random state and follow a few transitions

# Challenges with Procedurally Generated Content 

---

# Challenges

  * We've seen many ways to generate content 
  
  * How do we ensure that the content is good?
  
  * "Good" depends on the game, and the content 
  
  * If a random tree doesn't look perfect it's probably less bad than if a generated level is unwinnable
  
  * On the other hand: How many different things can we generate? (Expressive Range)
