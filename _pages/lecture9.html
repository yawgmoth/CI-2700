### Game Engine Basics

# Game Engines

class: small

# What is a Game Engine

  * Games are typically split between an engine and content 
  
  * The engine can usually support multiple different games (theoretically) 
  
  * Extensions to the game don't require changes to the engine (ideally)
  
  * Engine provides components for loading content, rendering, physics, networking, AI, sound, etc.
  
---

class: small

# Why?

  * Rendering, physics, etc. are reusable components
  
  * Good software engineering practice says they should be written separately
  
  * The game itself becomes smaller, and easier to change 
  
  * It becomes easier to make more games
  
  * Game Engine can be licensed

# How do I write a Game Engine?

## Don't!

---

class: center, middle

# But let's talk about how you would

---

# This is all you need (basically)

```C#

while (true)
{
    foreach(GameObject go in scene)
    {
        go.Update();
    }
    scene.Render();
    FrameSync();
}

```

---

class: small

# What's this?

```C#
foreach(GameObject go in scene)
```

   * A <b>GameObject</b> is an entity in the game 
    
       - Can be concrete, like an enemy
       
       - Or abstract, like physics, networking, input, ...
       
   * The <b>Scene</b> is the collection of GameObjects that is currently loaded/active
   
---

class: small

# What's this?

```C#
go.Update();
```

   * Every GameObject has an Update method, which is called every frame
   
   * Can be used to move or animate the game object, run AI behavior, sound effects, etc. 
   
---

class: small

# Moving

```C#
   public void Update()
   {
       position += new Vector3(3,0,0)*Time.deltaTime;
   }
```

  * Every frame the game object is moved in x direction 
  
  * Time.deltaTime represents the time since the last frame
  
  * The movement speed is 3 units per second 
  
---

class: center, middle

# Are there any problems with doing everything in Update()?

---

class: small

# Frames Per Second (FPS)

  * Ideally we want at least 25 FPS 
  
  * That means we have 40 ms per frame 
  
  * <b>All</b> Update() methods together need to need less than 40ms
  
  * We are also rendering things
  
  * What about slow calculations?
  
---

# Threads

  * Idea: Run computationally expensive calculations in their own thread 
  
  * Exchange information between threads using shared data structures
  
  * Access to data structures has to be synchronized to avoid consistency problems
  
  * What could possibly go wrong?
  
---

# Synchronization problems 

  * Thread A moves an object forward at a constant rate 
  
  * Thread B calculates the route for the object, and then moves it onto that route 
  
  * Which order are they going to be executed in?
  
  * How long does thread B need?
  
---

# One solution: Messaging

  * Only <b>one</b> (main) thread is allowed to touch the object's location
  
  * Other threads can <b>request</b> movement by sending a message to the main thread 
  
  * Can still do expensive computations in threads, but can not manipulate the scene
  
  * Main thread can rate-limit message processing

# Scenes

---

# Scenes

```C#
    scene.Render();
```

  * Many game objects will have representations on screeen
  
  * 2D/3D graphics, GUI Elements, particle effects, etc.
  
  * Where do we actually get all of these things from?

# Scene graph

  * Scene
    - Living Room
       * Fireplace
          - Wood
          - Fire
       * Carpet 
       * Couch
       * Player
          - Avatar
          - Weapon 
          - Pet
    
    - Hallway
       * Ceiling light
       * Coat hanger
       
---

# Scene graph

  * Spatial (or logical) grouping of game objects 
  
  * May load, move, manipulate entire sub-trees at once 
  
  * For example: Moving the player also moves their weapon and pet
  
---

# Building a scene graph

  * Load scene from file (e.g. XML)
  
  * Load 2D/3D models from model file 
  
  * Supported formats determined by game engine

# How do you ...

  * Shoot a bullet?
      - Create a Bullet Game Object
      - Update() moves the bullet forward
      - A physics collision removes the bullet from the scene
      - Or use a raycast
  * Detect collisions?
      - Physics subsystem calculates collisions
      - When a collision is found a message is sent to the objects involved
  * Make a multiplayer-game?
      - Networking runs in a thread 
      - Other player moves: message is sent to GameObject representation of that player
  * Change levels?
      - Load a new scene
