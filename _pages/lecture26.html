### Networked Games

class: center, middle

# Networking 

---

# Why Networking?

   - Players enjoy interacting with other players
   
   - Killers like messing with people 
   
   - Achievers like having leaderboards and showing off their achievements
   
   - Socializers like interacting with other people 
   
   - AI is not (yet?) perfect
   
---

# Networking Requirements

   - Fast: Should not adversely affect gameplay

   - Reliable: (Small) connection problems should not ruin the game 
   
   - Fair: No player is preferred/affected by other player's connection problems

   - Secure: Players can't cheat   
   
---

# Peer-to-Peer Games

  - In the olden days, games would simply connect all players with each other 
  
  - Every player runs the game on their machine 
  
  - When someone moves, the move is sent to all players and their copy of the game state performs it 
  
  - How can we synchronize the moves, so that all players have the same game state?
  
---

# Lockstep Networking

  - Let's assume our game has "turns"
  
  - When it is a player's turn, they send the action they perform to everyone else 
  
  - Players synchronize game states using turn order 
  
  - Note: Real-time games can use this, too, by using "very short turns" (e.g. 10ms)
  
---

# Lockstep Networking: Limitations

  - The game needs to be deterministic

  - Connection problems produce noticeable wait times 
  
  - Worse, *any* player's connection problems affect *every* player 
  
  - Also, what if the players do not agree on the game state (perhaps because someone is cheating)?
  
---

# Quick Aside: Reproducibility

  - Game States may also become inconsistent for benign reasons
  
  - For example: The physics simulation may produce different results 
  
  - One cause: Physics engines use random order of resolving collisions
  
  - Other option: Floating point math is not consistent across different machines 
  
---

class: small

# Quick Aside: Reproducibility of Floating Point math 

  - The (original) Intel FPU used 80 bit floats internally 
  
  - Float and double data types had 32 and 64 bit, though 
  
  - When the value was written from the FPU to memory, it was rounded 
  
  - However, the timing of that was unpredictable (e.g. on context-switches)
  
  - And, of course, compiler flags, register allocation, etc. can all also affect the behavior

---

# Client-Server Games

  - Instead of letting every player keep track of the game state themselves, let's use a central server 
  
  - The server is the authority on the correctness of the game state, the clients only display it 
  
  - When a player wants to perform an action, a request is sent to the server, and the action is only performed if the player is allowed to do so
  
---

# Client-Server Games: Challenges

  - The server needs to respond to client requests quickly
  
  - However, there can still be a delay between the request and the answer 
  
  - Clients should (ideally) not know anything the player should not know 
  
  - What if there are network delays?

# A word from John Carmack

"While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at &lt; 200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User's modem. ISP's modem. Server. ISP's modem. User's modem. Client. God, that sucks. Ok, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familiar with PPP life. I'm addressing it now."

---

# Client-Side Prediction

  - In the original model, if you press a button, you have to wait for the server to answer to actually move
  
  - But the client could know/expect/*predict* that the button press will cause movement 
  
  - Then, when the server confirms the coordinates, the client synchronizes with that information
  
  - Problem: The client tells the server about updates "in the past"
  
---

class: small

# Dead-Reckoning

  - Remember Newton's first law? Objects in motion will stay in motion (unless a force acts on them)
  
  - The client can assume that for non-player objects 
  
  - When the server sends another update, the client reconciles the actual information with their prediction
  
  - For example: If a character is moving forward, the client can keep moving them forward until the server tells them otherwise
  
  - The client can also use the game mechanics to predict changes in movement (e.g. through collision)

# Example: With 100ms delay

  - t = 0: Player 1 sees player 2 in crosshair and presses "fire" button, client sends the "shoot" action to the server; client 1 predicts that player 2 was hit and killed 
  
  - t = 100ms: The server receives the "shoot" action from player 1, but player 2 is not longer in the crosshair 
  
  - t = 200ms: Client 1 gets response from server; Player 1 missed the shot, and player 2 isn't dead after all
  
  - Player 1 feels bad, because they "definitely" hit player 2

---

# Lag Reduction

  - The server keeps track of past game states 
  
  - When a player performs an action, the server applies it to the game state at the appropriate time in the past 
  
  - This means the server must also re-apply other players' actions that happen afterwards
  
  - Advantage: Most of the time, a player's action will have the effect they see on their screen
  
---

class: small

# Example: With 100ms delay

  - t = 0: Player 1 sees player 2 in crosshair and presses "fire" button, client sends the "shoot" action to the server; client 1 predicts that player 2 was hit and killed 
  
  - t = 100ms: The server receives the "shoot" action from player 1 *with the timestamp information*, and applies it to the game state at t = 0, resulting in a new game state in which player 2 is dead
  
  - t = 200ms: Client 1 gets response from server, they hit player 2 and killed them
  
---

class: small

# But what about player 2?

  - t = 0: Player 2 is visible to player 1
  
  - t = 100ms: Player 2 is behind a wall
  
  - t = 200ms: Client 2 gets a message from the server telling them that player 2 died (at t=0)
  
  - Player 2 feels bad because they were hit "while they were behind a wall"
  
---

class: small

# Trade-off 

  - This system is actually fair: Both players have the same chances 
  
  - However, it favors active behavior, because a player's own actions are reflected in the game state more readily than actions that are performed *on* the player 
  
  - In many cases, especially in shooters, players are running towards or away from their enemies
  
  - Often the delay is also not large enough for players to actually notice, since they also need some time to process what is happening to them
  
  - Keeping track of historical states is expensive for many players
  
---

# Trust the Client?

  - As we discussed earlier: The client can not be trusted
  
  - How about Hybrid Hit Detection (such as in Battlefield 3)?
  
  - The *client* says when they hit someone 
  
  - The server performs a plausibility test

---

# Cheating 

  - The server is the authority on the game state 
  
  - However, to be able to predict movement, the client needs to know the positions of other players 
  
  - By extracting information from the binary game state, cheat programs can "see" enemies through walls 
  
  - Other cheating methods include disabling or manipulating the z-Buffer to draw hidden enemies
  
---

# Anti-Cheating measures 

There is no method that is 100% effective against all forms of cheating, but a few things that are done are:
  
  - Scan game binaries for modifications 
  
  - Look for known cheat software that is running 
  
  - Run game in a sandbox that can't be tampered with
  
  - Check for graphics card driver modifications/settings

---

# Scalability

  - Games vary in the number of concurrent players 
  
  - If you only have a few dozen players, one server can handle them 
  
  - For hundreds or thousands of players, more sophisticated techniques are needed

# MMO Server Architecture

# MMO Game Servers

  - Typically the game is split into maps/regions/areas 
  
  - Each area can be served by multiple physical servers 
  
  - When a player moves from one area to another they are transferred to a server for that area 
  
  - Two players in the same area may still be on different servers
  
  - When a server becomes too crowded, it may be split into two ("sharding")
  
---

# A Quick Word on MMO Servers

  - Having multiple servers saves resources, but also splits the player base 
  
  - As games evolve, some areas get abandoned 
  
  - With a split up player base, this effect becomes more pronounced 

  - MMO companies have started using concepts like "megaservers" or "(dynamic) sharding" to merge players from multiple servers in low-population areas

# Networking in Unity

  - Unity provides a `NetworkManager` class to handle common network tasks
  
  - There is also a (very) basic matchmakig UI (for testing purposes)
  
  - For each player you need to have one "player game object" to handle how they can affect the game 
  
  - Other game objects need to define whether the server has authority over what happens to them, or a player
  
  - Games with specific networking needs should implement their own

# Networked player movement 

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;

public class Controls : NetworkBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (!isLocalPlayer)
        {
            // exit from update if this is not the local player
            return;
        }

        // handle player input for movement
    }
}
```

class: small

# Networking-Aware Game Objects 

  - Add a `NetworkIdentity` component to your game objects
  
  - Add a `NetworkTransform` component to game objects to synchronize their positions/rotations/scaling
  
  - Spawn new objects using `NetworkServer.Spawn`
  
  - Make your scripts derive from `NetworkBehavior` instead of `MonoBehavior`
  
  - In your scripts, only modify the game object when `hasAuthority` is true (or `isServer`)
  
  - If you want to synchronize non-transform attributes, mark them with `[SyncVar]`

# Networking in WebGL builds

  - The built-in NetworkManager etc. work with WebGL builds 
  
  - If you want to build your own, you can't use raw sockets 
  
  - Other options: `WWW` or `UnityWebRequest`, which can be used to send HTTP requests 
  
  - The server needs to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  
  - Do not block on network requests (WebGL is single-threaded)
