### Player Analytics

---

class: center, middle

# Player Rankings 

---

# Player Ratings

  - Let's say you have a multiplayer game 
  
  - Your (competitive) players want to know how good they are 
  
  - Players also don't want to play against players that are much stronger or weaker than them
  
  - But if a player beats a stronger player that should count more than if they beat a weaker player

---

class: small

# ELO

  - Chess, and many other games, use a rating system called ELO, where each player is assigned a numerical rating 
  
  - When two players play, the difference in their current rating is used to calculate their "estimated chances of winning"
  
  - Each match is worth a number of points
  
  - At the end of the match, the winning player gets a percentage of those points equal to their estimated chances of losing from the losing player
  
  - A player that was unlikely to win (because their rating was much lower than their opponents) can get more points from winning than an evenly matched player
  
---

# ELO: Limitations 

  - The ratings just provide an *estimate* for winning probabilities, but they do not tell us how good that estimate is 
  
  - Players might be incentivized to "sit on their rating"
  
  - ELO in team games may not accurately reflect any single player's skill
  
  - New players have to have some rating, which can be abused ("smurfing")
  
---

class: small

# Some Improvements

  - Decaying ratings over time encourages active play
  
  - The Glicko/Glicko-2 rating systems consist of two numbers: the rating and a "reliability"
  
  - This addition helps with better comparing two player's "true" skill
  
  - It also helps with smurfing, because new players have a lower "reliability" on their rating 
  
  - Still does not take individual performance in team games into account (TrueSkill does/can)
  
---

class: small

# Rankings and Matchmaking

  - Once every player has a rating, they can be ranked in descending order 
  
  - When creating matches to play, several aspects have to be taken into account:
  
     * Ratings
     * Teams
     * Parties
     * Queue Times
     
  - Two main approaches:
     
     * Timed Queues 
     * On-demand matches

# Player Analytics

# Why Player Analytics?

  - Games are expensive to make
  
  - Players often abandon games quickly
  
  - We want to know what players *do* in our games to keep them engaged
  
  - Related: We also want to make money  
  
---

# Player Analytics

  - We can collect data while players play the game 
  
  - This data can then be analyzed to answer questions/confirm hypotheses
  
  - The answers to these questions can then inform game design
  
  - Typically, you want the players to keep playing your game, and use all your content 
  
  - Or you might want to know *what kind* of content you should make more of

---

# Player Retention

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/android_retention.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Player Retention

  - Good first impression/new player experience 
  
  - Good challenge curve/flow
  
  - Delayed rewards (daily log-in bonus, loot chest with a key coming later, etc.)
  
  - Give player a personalization/progression choice
  
  - Social features, invite and team play rewards (see also: player acquisition)

# Madden NFL

  - Madden NFL is a game where you play American football 
  
  - Researchers (in collaboration with EA) analyzed game log data 
  
  - They built a statistical model to predict how many games a player would play 
  
  - Using this model, they identified features which result in higher player retention 
  
  - Game design can focus on improving these features
  
---

# Madden NFL: Features 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/nflfeatures.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Player Modeling
  
  - You can personalize content, or just focus on more common types of players
  
  - How do you determine "types" of players?
  
  - Your game can track player actions and report back!
  
  - Especially in open world games, determining what players spend their time on is beneficial to focus future development or guide players to underexplored areas

---

# Player Profiles
  
  - On the other hand, you also want to know *who* plays your games 
  
  - Geographic region, age range, maybe personal details, personality
  
  - Why? So you can target ads 
  
  - Play patterns are also important: time of day, session length, number of games per week
  
---

# Player Profiles: How do you get this data?

  - IP Geolocation tells you the region
  
  - Provide a birthday bonus to incentivize players to tell you their birthday
  
  - Connect to facebook to get personal details
  
  - Statistical models: Play style and personality have been shown to be related 
  
---

# Machine Learning for Player Analytics

  - Some machine learning techniques can be used to analyze collected data 
  
  - For example, if we want to know which "types" of players exist, we can use clustering
  
  - If we want to *predict* what the player is likely to do, we can use supervised learning (e.g. a neural network)
  
  - We can also learn a player's preferences (e.g. which weapon they are likely to favor)
  
---

# How to use this information in Game Play
  
  - Marketing is nice and important, but can we use this for actual mechanics?
  
  - Of course!
  
  - Say a large portion of your players typically play from 7-10pm
  
  - Put large in-game events at 8pm
  
  - You can cater the type of event to the typical player population
  
---

# How to use this information in Game Play
  
  - If you know your players are going to favor a certain kind of weapon, you can focus on making more of these weapons in the future 
  
  - You can even use the learned models *during* development of future versions to predict where players might go more 
  
  - Player types can inform the kind of content you should focus on

---

# Game Play Statistics 

  - So you have your game and you collect data
  
  - Then you analyze what content which players are consuming and when
  
  - But you already invested all this time and effort?
  
  - Let's look at an example

---

# Project Gotham Racing 4

# Project Gotham Racing 4

  - Single player *and* multi player 
  
  - 10 different game modes: career, arcade, network race, tournaments, time attack, etc.
  
  - 29 "event types": street race, elimination, cat and mouse, etc.
  
  - 134 cars with 7 different ratings (easy to hard to control)
  
  - 9 cities with a total of 121 race tracks
  
  - Development cost: "a fortune" (per Business Director Brian Woodhouse)
  
---

class: small

# Project Gotham Racing 4: Analysis

  - 4 researchers (including one from the publisher) analyzed 3.1 million game logs 
  
  - Overall, 30-40% of the content was used in less than 1% of games
  
  - Game modes: Network tournaments were used in less than 0.1% of games 
  
  - 12 of the 29 event types were used in less than 1% of games 
  
  - 50 cars were used in less than 0.25% of races
  
  - 47 race tracks were used in less than 0.5% of races *each* (13% together)

# Project Gotham Racing 4: What to do?

  - First observation: More is not always better 
  
  - The data can be used when developing a successor 
  
  - But there would also have been a better way to develop *this* game: 
  
     * Release a small/core version of the game with less content 
     * Add content *where it is needed*
     * You will spend less money overall, even though you provide "free content updates"
     
  - Claim: An analysis like this might cost $50-$100k, but will save $0.5-$2 million

# Player Acquisition

  - Marketing: Next week 
  
  - For now, let's talk about *mechanics* that encourage player acquisition

  - Once you have players, you want them to invite their friends

  - The power of social connections
  
---

class: small

# Player Acquisition 

  - Say you have a game in which you tend to *your* farm
  
  - You can make money that allows you to buy more things for your farm
  
  - Some (fancy) things you can only buy with real money, though 
  
  - Unless your friend (who also plays the game) "gives" them to you (*they* don't have to pay) 
  
  - Of course you also *have to* tend to your crops (or they die)
  
  - But a friend can help you out on your farm
  
---

# Player Acquisition: Other tactics

  - Get a bonus for posting a status on facebook that allows your friends to perform some in-game action
  
  - Make content harder to beat alone
  
  - There is a fine line between designing mechanics for player acquisition and aggressive marketing
  
  - The actual game play should still be enjoyable
  
---

# But we don't have any game yet!

  - Many of the analytics options are only available to the developers 
  
  - But there are APIs to extract replays for many games 
  
  - You can run analytics on these replays to find out what players do in *other* games to learn their preference 
  
  - This can inform design decisions for your own game

# Unity Analytics

  - Unity has built-in support for data collection 
  
  - To enable analytics, open the Services window under Windows -&gt; General -&gt; Services and switch Analytics to "On"
  
  - By default it will collect:
  
      * New installs
      * Daily/Monthly active users 
      * Sessions (total/per user)
      * Time spent 
      * Users by geographic region, OS, life cycle
      
  - There are many other standard events you can use, or create custom ones
  
  - Also integrates with monetization options
  
---

# Unity Analytics: Funnels

  - There are many ways to analyze the collected data
  
  - One of the more common ones: Funnels 
  
  - You measure the progress through some linear progression (e.g. the tutorial)
  
  - The "funnel" will show you how far players make it through the progression, i.e. where you lose players
  
```C#
AnalyticsEvent.LevelStart(thisScene.name, 
                                      thisScene.buildIndex);
```

# Unity Analytics: Heatmaps

  - You may also be interested *where* in your game things happen 
  
  - Where do players go often, where do they die 
  
  - There is a Heatmap extension for Unity analytics, where you send analytics events with a location 
  
  - Requires Unity Pro :(

# The EU General Data Protection Regulation

  - Remember getting emails from every website telling you that they collect personally identifiable information?
  
  - That's because of the EU GDPR 
  
  - Use the Unity Analytics Data Privacy Plug-in
  
  - This plug-in includes a button you can place in your game for players to opt out of data collection (and see which data was already collected)
  
  - Make sure, *you* don't send personally identifiable information in your analytics events
