# Question 

Imagine a game where you and an opponent alternate with choosing bits for a binary number, until the number has 3 digits. If the resulting number is prime, you get points equal to its value, otherwise you lose points equal to its value. Draw the game tree for this game. What is your best first move?

Example:

You pick 0, your opponent picks 1, then you pick 1. The number is 011 in binary, or 3 in decimal, so you get 3 points.

# Physics Simulation

---

# Question 

Say you have an object with 100kg, and apply a force of 10N to it. What acceleration will the object experience?

--

If we apply this force for 5 seconds, how fast will the object be moving afterwards?

--

If the object starts at the origin (0,0,0), we apply the force for 5 seconds, where will the object be located after a total of 10 seconds? (Assume the physics simulation runs once per second)

# Collision Detection

---

# Question 

When is the dot product of two vectors greater than, less than, and equal to zero, (given their relative directions)?

---

# Question 

Say we have 3 spheres, S1, S2, and S3, each with radius 2. S1 is located at (0,0,0), S2 is located at (3,4,0), and S3 is located at (4,0,3). Which of these sphere intersect, if any?


---

# Question

Let there be a sphere S1 at (8,4,2) with radius 5, and another sphere S2 with radius 1 at (0,0,0). S2 then starts moving in x-direction with 1m/s. At what time 
do the two spheres collide?

--

Hint:

You can take the position of S2 as (t,0,0), and find the (smaller) value for t for which the two spheres collide.

---

# Question

Given a ray R starting at (0,1,0), in direction (1,0,0), where is the projection of the center of the sphere S1, which is located at (6,3,0), on that ray?

--

Assume the sphere has radius 4. Does the ray intersect the sphere? If yes, where?

--

Assume the sphere has radius 5. Does the ray intersect the sphere? If yes, where?

# Question 

In your game players can get a sword that should deal 100 damage on average according to your balancing. Which of these five options would you choose, and why?

  - A sword that always deals 100 damage 
  
  - A sword that deals a random amount of damage between 75 and 125 (uniformly distributed)
  
  - A sword that deals a random amount of damage between 50 and 150, with a normal distribution centered at 100
  
  - A sword that deals 100 damage on the first hit, 80 on the second hit, and 120 on the third hit
  
  - A sword that deals between 80 and 100 damage at random (uniformly distributed), but if you deal less than 100 damage, you get 10 bonus damage on the next attack (stacking, until you deal 100 or more damage)
