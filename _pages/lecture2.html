# What is a game?

---

# David Parlett (game historian)

A (formal) game consists of ends and means

 * Ends: Games are a contest to achieve some goal.
 
 * Means: There is a formal definition of rules
 
---

# Clark C. Abt (author)

"A game is an activity among two or more independent decision makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context"

  * Activity
  
  * Decisions 
  
  * Goals
  
  * Limits/Rules
 
---
 
# Johann Huizinga (Anthropologist)

Play is:
   
   * outside ordinary life
   * not serious   
   * utterly absorbing
   * not about material profit
   * placed in its own boundaries
   * rule-based 
   * social group forming
   
---

# Roger Caillois (Sociologist)

Play is:
   
   * voluntary
   * a diversion
   * limited in time and space 
   * uncertain
   * unproductive
   * governed by rules
   * make-belief 
   
---

# Bernard Suits (Philosopher)

"Playing a game is the voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles"

  * Rule-based (limited)
  
  * Goal-oriented
  
  * Inefficient
  
  * Rules are accepted *because* they are inefficient
  
---

# Chris Crawford (Video game designer)

Games are 

 * closed, formal systems
 
 * interactive
 
 * conflict-based
 
 * safe
 
---
 
# Greg Costikyan (Game designer)

"A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal."

  * Art 
  
  * Decision making
  
  * Resource management
  
  * Game tokens
  
  * Goal-based
 
---

# Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith (Game scholars)

"Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest between powers, confined by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome."

  * Exercise of control system
  
  * Voluntary
  
  * Confined by rules 
  
  * Disequilibrial outcome
  
---

# Mark Rosewater (Game designer)

A game is a thing with a goal (or goals), restrictions, agency, and a lack of real-world relevance.

Every game needs:
   * Goals
   * Rules 
   * Interaction
   * A Catch-Up feature
   * Inertia
   * Surprise
   * Strategy
   * Fun
   * Flavor
   * A "hook"

# Video game taxonomy

Genres establish conventions for mechanics, but as designers we want to talk more about the mechanics themselves

  * Real time vs. turn-based 
  
  * Competitive, cooperative, single player 
  
  * Social vs. Non-social 
  
  * Strategy vs. Dexterity
  
  * Perfect information vs. imperfect information
