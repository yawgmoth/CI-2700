### Testing and Balancing

# Why testing?

# Phases of Game Testing 

---

# Alpha Testing 

  - Parallel to development 
  
  - Game is still unfinished, changing rapidly
  
  - Probably not a lot of fun to play 
  
  - Art assets, UI, etc. might still be missing/be in a temporary state

---

# Beta Testing 

  - The game itself should be "finished"
  
  - The main task is to find major issues 
  
  - Try to break the game in any way possible 
  
  - Open or Closed Beta: Invite Customers to play the game before release and find bugs 

---

# Pre-Production

  - Final checks 
  
  - Make sure game actually installs and starts as planned in a production environment
  
  - Compliance checks and certification

---

# Alternative approaches 

  - Indie development may not have such clear defined stages

  - Early Access 
  
  - Continuous development and deployment
  
  - Working closer with the player community
  
---

class: center, middle

# Types of Bugs 

---

# The obvious ones 

   - Crashes 
   
   - Game freezes 
   
   - Buttons don't work 
   
   - Screen stays black 
   
   - etc.
   
---

# Game Bugs 

   - Beyond just "classical" software bugs, games, as complex systems, also have many other sources for errors 
   
   - Some of these might be hard to find or judge 
   
   - For example, how do you determine if a mechanic is "fun"?
   
   - How do you judge if a game is "easy" or "hard"
   
   - Companies are trying to get players involved earlier
   
---

class: small

# Game Play Bugs 

   - The designer has a vision for how the game should play 
   
   - There are two things that can go wrong there:
   
      * The players can not follow the vision of the designer, for example because the timing of mechanics/attacks is wrong
      * It is better/easier to perform actions other than the ones the designer intended, basically exploiting the rules 
      
   - Problems with mechanics can be found through game play testing
   
   - To find possible exploits, the testers need to be creative/think like an adversary
   
---

# Physics Problems

   - Say you have a game where players can destroy the environment 
   
   - The player blows up a wall, and a barrel starts rolling uphill
   
   - This may be plausible, due to the explosion blast, but it may also be "unrealistic"
   
   - Challenge: How to do you quantify "unrealistic"?
   
---

# AI Problems

   - Even harder than determining if physics are "good" is determining if AI agents are "good"
   
   - The AI agents will not behave like humans
   
   - They might not even be "good"
   
   - But they should be "good enough"

# Some (in)famous examples of bugs

When you get to this room, you have to talk to Shad *before* you save and quit. He will not be there on reload, and is necessary to progress.

# Pool Of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/poolofradiance.jpg" width="80%"/>

Pool Of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor was a mediocre RPG, but when you uninstalled it, it would also delete some important Windows system files and your computer wouldn't boot anymore.

# Testing Aids 
 
---

class: small

# Software Testing

   - You can use the same techniques as for regular software testing 
   
   - Unit Tests: Test each functional unit
   
   - Regression Tests: Write a test for bugs that were fixed to prevent them from reoccuring
   
   - Smoke Tests: A quick test after every build to ensure the game still starts 
    
   - Soak Tests: Let the game run for many hours/days to detect memory leaks
   
---

class: small

# Unity Testing Framework 

  - Under Window -&gt; General -&gt; Test Runner you can find Unity's test framework 
  
  - It is basically a wrapper around NUnit
  
```C#
[UnityTest]
public IEnumerator GameObjectAffectedByPhysics()
{
    var go = new GameObject();
    go.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();
    var originalPosition = go.transform.position.y;

    yield return new WaitForFixedUpdate();

    Assert.AreNotEqual(originalPosition,go.transform.position.y);
}
```

# Monkey Testing 

   - An infinite number of monkeys on infinitely many typewriters will [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) eventually [write Shakespeare](https://web.archive.org/web/20130120215600/http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf)
   
   - Or they could test your game!
   
   - Feed random input into your game and make sure "nothing bad" happens
   
   - Just make sure to record the input so you can reproduce the bugs
   
   - Challenge: How do you define "nothing bad"?
   
(Note: Don't use actual monkeys)
   
---

class: small

# AI Play

   - Monkeys are probably not going to beat your game
   
   - But maybe an AI could?
   
   - Build an AI agent that plays through the game (it doesn't need to be perfect)
   
   - In fact, it's better if it is not perfect, and tries unusual tactics 
   
   - If a bad AI can beat your game, so can your players!

# Balancing

---

# Balancing 

  - We already discussed "easy" vs. "hard"
  
  - But what can you do to change that?
  
  - Also, what if players actually play against each other?
  
  - And which rewards do you give players?
  
---

# Balancing: Basics 

  - The best basis for balancing is math 
  
  - You want to know the relative strength of every item/unit in your game 
  
  - Build an Excel sheet (or code) that can tell you how good any combination of items/units is
  
  - Tweak numbers in the Excel sheet until the relative strengths are what you want 
  
  - And then playtest!

---

# Random-Number Generation

  - Many players hate Random Number Generation (RNG) in games 
  
  - But it actually serves important purposes
  
  - Randomization helps with replayability
  
  - It also helps with player engagement and retention 
  
  - The problem is "too much" randomness
  
---

class: small

# RNG for Replayability 

  - Many games use randomized levels to keep things fresh 
  
  - Card games typically shuffle the deck 
  
  - Bobby Fischer suggested Chess960 because he felt chess got stale from people using memorized openings
  
  - If the outcome of a match is less certain it is also more likely that you'll try again if you lose
  
  - Conversely: If you lose, you can always just blame "bad luck", rather than admitting that you made mistakes
  
---

class: small

# RNG for Player Engagement and Retention

  - Studies in rats: If a lever gives a reward every time, or consistently every n times, the rats actually get bored and stop using the lever. If it gives rewards randomly instead, they will keep trying.
  
  - If you give your players a legendary item every 10 bosses they are more likely to get bored than if they get it randomly 10% of the time 
  
  - People have trouble with perceiving randomness, though 
  
  - If a player kills 20 bosses and doesn't get a legendary, they will claim the game is broken, even though that should happen in 12% of the cases 
  
  - 1.5% of players would even have to kill 40 bosses to get a legendary
  
---

# RNG is bad

  - Now we have a problem: RNG is good for the game, but too much of it makes players feel bad 
  
  - What if we "fix" our randomness if it gets too bad 
  
  - You still want "some" randomness, but it should be much less likely to get extreme results 
  
  - This actually applies to game play as well as rewards!
  
---

class: small

# Random Number Smoothing 

  - Consider a game with a percentage chance to get a critical hit ("crit") which deals double damage 
  
  - Say you have a 35% chance of dealing a critical hit
  
  - If a player is "really lucky" they might deal 5 crits in a row
  
  - Conversely, a player that is really unlucky might not get any crits in 10 attacks
  
  - What if we actually start with lower odds, but if you miss, you get a bonus on your chances?

# Random Number Smoothing 

<table><tr><td><img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/rage.png" width="200pt"/></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li> This item used to exist in Smite

<li>Your initial odds of landing a critical hit are lower

<li>If you miss, you will get a higher chance of critical hits 

<li>In effect, you still have a 35% chance of landing a critical hit, but it is less likely that you have many in a row, or many misses in a row</ul>
</td></tr></table>

# Random Number Smoothing 

  - Games do this all the time!
  
  - Diablo 3: If you don't get a legendary item for a long time, your odds are increased over time 
  
  - Crusaders of the Lost Idols: Every 4th chest is guaranteed to be a "golden chest"
  
  - Smite: Crit-smoothing items
  
  - League of Legends: Critical Strike Smoothing Algorithm
