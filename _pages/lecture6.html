# Player Types

---

# Bartle's taxonomy of player types

  * Killers 
  
  * Achievers
  
  * Explorers
  
  * Socializers
  
---

# Killers

  * Want power 
  
  * Want to exert control over others
  
  * Create chaos
  
  * Sometimes problematic griefing behavior
  
---

# Achievers

  * Want to collect wealth
  
  * Care about points, leaderboards, in-game currency
  
  * Leveling up is important
  
  * Are more willing to "grind" to gain advantages than other player types
  
---

# Explorers

  * Want to find patterns 
  
  * Geography: Patterns in landscape 
  
  * Strategy: Patterns in the rules
  
  * Seek knowledge
  
---

# Socializers

  * Care about people (virtual or real)
  
  * Want to interact with other players/non-players in meaningful ways
  
  * Enjoy roleplaying
  
  * Are often active in guilds, clans, etc.

# Notes

  * Aren't these four types just the four Hogwarts houses?
     
     - Killer: Slytherin
     - Achiever: Gryffindor
     - Explorer: Ravenclaw
     - Socializer: Hufflepuff
  
---

# Notes
  
  * They are definitely related to Myers-Briggs personality types (via David Keirsey):
  
     - Killer: Artisan (Sensing, Perceiving)
     - Achiever: Guardian (Sensing, Judging)
     - Explorer: Rational (Intuition, Thinking)
     - Socializer: Idealist (Intuition, Feeling)

# Why do we care?
  
  * Ultimately, games are for players 
  
  * Different players want different things 
  
  * Understanding what players want helps us design better games for them
  
  * Understanding that there is a difference between players allows us to cater content to specific types

# Flow

# Flow

  * Experimentally validated by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in the 70s
  
  * For any task
  
     - If it's too hard: people get anxious
     
     - If it's too easy: people get bored
     
  * What is easy/hard changes with skill
  
  * Skill improves over time!
  
  * While in the "flow", people are focused purely on the task

# Flow

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/flow.png" width="70%"/>

---

class: small

# Flow

To stay in the "flow", players need

  * Concrete goals, and consistent rules
  
  * Actions to achieve these goals that they can accomplish
  
  * Clear and timely feedback
  
  * No distractions
  
---

class: small

# Flow - In Games

What this means for games:

  * Provide the player with something to do 
  
  * Don't change the rules drastically
  
  * Increase difficulty incrementally, as players get better
  
  * Tell the player how they are doing on their goals
  
  * Don't overwhelm the player with information
  
---

class: small

# How games keep you in the flow

  * Give you a better weapon when killing monsters gets too hard
  
  * Introduce new mechanics gradually, then mix and match
  
  * Split missions up into smaller sub-tasks of increasing complexity
  
  * Progress feedback

# Educational games?

# Educational games 

  * Learn concepts using games 
  
  * For example, math puzzles, physics concepts 
  
  * Conveyed through mechanics and/or story
  
  * Effectiveness still under investigation
