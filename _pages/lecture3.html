# Games as Systems

# What is a System?

A system is

  * a group of
  
  * interacting, 
  
  * interrelated, and

  * interdependent
  
  * components

A system is

  * <b>components</b>

# Components?

## What do we have in a game?

## What do we have in a game?
 
Super Mario

---

class: small

# Components 

  * Objects
    - Player
    - Enemies (Goomba, Koopa Troopa)
    - Items (Mushroom, coin, flower)
    - Level geometry
    - Score, lives
    - Buttons (input)
  * Attributes 
    - Where is Mario? Is he in the air (jumping)?
    - Is Mario small/large?
    - Which way is the Goomba facing?
    - Is the Koopa Troopa in its shell?
  * Relationships
    - Pressing buttons makes Mario move/jump/shoot
    - Mushroom makes Mario grow
    - Jumping on Goomba destroys it
    - Running into Goomba makes the player lose a life and start over
    - Coins give points
  * Environment
    - NES: Controller, memory, TV screen
    - Single player, local multiplayer

# Framing

  * Formal
    - View the game as a set of rules
    - Closed off from the outside environment
    - Super Mario gameplay
    
  * Experiental
    - View the game as an experience for the players
    - Not about the mechanics, but about the effect they have on the player 
    - Super Mario as a test of skill/reaction time
    
  * Cultural
    - View the game as a cultural artifact
    - Impact of the game on society/culture
    - Super Mario as a pioneer in video games 
    - Impact of gender dynamics: Mario rescuing the princess

# Rules: Game Mechanics

The game mechanics describe the interactions between the objects in detail 

  * Controls 
  
  * Friendly behavior
  
  * Enemy behavior
  
  * Level behavior 
  
  * Win/loss conditions, scoring
  
---

# Controls

Controls are easy:

  * Left/right make Mario move left/right 

  * Button A makes Mario jump 

  * Button B makes Mario shoot a fireball

--

But Mario can not always shoot fireballs?

---

class: small

# Interaction

Let's add an interaction rule:

  * If Mario collides with a fire flower power-up ... 
  
--

Actually, we need something to interact with:

  * Attribute: Mario can have the "shoot" ability (bool)
  
  * If Mario collides with a fire flower power-up he gets the shoot ability 
  
  * If Mario collides with an enemy, and he has the shoot ability, he loses it

---

# Controls

Controls are (now) easy:

  * Left/right make Mario move left/right 

  * Button A makes Mario jump 

  * Button B makes Mario shoot a fireball <b>if Mario has the shoot ability</b>
  
---

# Enemy Behavior: AI! (sort of)

What does a Goomba do?

  * Face left initially (attribute)
  
  * Walk
  
  * If a wall is hit (interaction with the level!), flip 180 degrees
  
  * Keep walking
  
--

I would not call this "AI", but what is important is that it <b>plays well</b>

---

# Summary 

  * Games consist of objects, attributes and interactions, and are situtated in an environment 
  
  * The mechanics define the rules by which objects interact and change their attributes 
  
  * Game design consists of defining these interactions
  
  * Important: Player experience (we will talk about this in a future class)

# Goals

## What do we want the player to do?

---

class: medium

# Goals

  * Reach the end of the level/section/story chapter
  
  * Win a particular game/combat 
    - Can be combined with a "metagame"
    - Many PvP online games do this 
    
  * Quests/incremental advantages/scoring
  
  * Don't give the player any particular goal at all (sandbox)
  
  * Combinations
  
---

# Levels, sections, chapters

  * Linear progression 
  
  * Easy to define 
  
  * Can control player experience more finely
  
  * Players are now asking for more autonomy
  
  * Level-based design can still work well!
  
---

# Game/combat wins

  * Typically for competitive games
  
  * Each game is self-contained 
  
  * Outside progression adds a meta-game 
  
  * Often tied to monetization strategy
    - Win games to unlock characters/weapons/cosmetic items
    - Or buy them
    
  * Can also be used as a teaching tool
  
---

# Quests/incremental advantages/scoring

  * Kill monsters until it gets hard
  
  * Get a better weapon 
  
  * Killing monsters is easier again 
  
  * Repeat 
  
  * Taken to the extreme: Idle games
  
---

# Sandbox

  * Create a world with many options 
  
  * Let the players choose what to do
  
  * Typically there is some conflict present
  
---

# Combinations

  * Scoring and levels: Improve on simple binary win/lose 
  
  * Quests and sandbox: Guide player 
  
  * Incremental advantage and levels: Make future levels easier 
  
  * Meta-game in combat-based games often provides incremental advantages or points
